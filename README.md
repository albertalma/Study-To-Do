# StudyToDo

StudyToDo is an Android prototype app created for the mobile apps contest [FIBApps 2014](http://www.fibalumni.net/portal/faces/public/cerclefiber/ecatwiki?portal:componentId=ewiki&portal:type=render&portal:isSecure=false&groupid=13d3a92f19bd5aa70119c3ba6dd90009&wikiId=13d3a95e42b1b0ac0142b2e731bb0009), organized by the Barcelona School of Informatics ([FIB](http://fib.upc.edu)) and its alumni institution, [FIBAlumni](http://www.fibalumni.net), for the 12th [FestiBITy](http://www.festibity.com/altres_edicions/festibity14/index.html).

The app, developed jointly by [Albert Almà Serrano](https://github.com/albertalma) and [David Martínez Rodríguez](https://github.com/necavit), ranked **4th** in the contest, not making it to the podium, but earning us a ticket to attend to the FestiBITy event.

> **NOTE:** the development of the app was discontinued after it was submitted to the FIBApps contest, mainly due to a lack of time and to the lack of a business model or sufficient funds.

## The concept

StudyToDo is an academic task manager. Courses can be created and tasks assigned to them, which can be evaluated on completion, providing feedback to the user about his or her progress in the course.

Additional information about the teachers in a course or recurrently scheduled lectures to be shown in a day-to-day calendar view can be also input in the app's database, easing the management of academic-related work for students.

## Demo video

You can find the demo video submitted to the FIBApps 2014 contest on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/user27320004/studytodofibapps). The video is in Catalan, but shows some of the implemented features in the app, such as courses and tasks creation, tasks completion and information display (tasks, courses or scheduled lectures).
